										<h2><a href="#">TECHTRONIX SALES ANALYSIS Using PowerBI Tool<br />

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/RObotic.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
<p>                                    It was observed that the tech company's cost of producing low demand products
                                        is high which is a loss to the company by 15%. Identifying the possibilities
                                        of profitable market was also a challenge. After analysis, we suggested that
                                         the organization implement a cost reduction strategy without affecting product's
                                         quality. A market survey was also recommended to see the 
                                         possibilities of increasing sales cost to generate more revenue. Aggressive sales
                                         promotions should be considered featuring the use and benefits of the low demand products
                                         as many are not familiar with the products. That yielded more sales by 20%.

									<p>The company had a challenge of understocked and overstocked
                                        of products, understandng seasonal trend and customer
                                         satisfaction. After analysis, the best seller product was identified. It was also 
                                         observed that promotions and seasons do not affect sales. It was suggested that the inventory
                                         of the best seller product should be increased, while they periodically
                                         consider a feedback strategy from customers to enable them improve in their 
                                         service and make an informed decision that increase revenue by 10%
                                         because they were able to stock more of the products that are always in demand
                                         and mininmise cost by 15%.
